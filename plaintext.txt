she stands up in the garden where she has been working and looks in to
the distance she has sensed a change in the weather there is another 
gust of wind a buckle of noise in the air and thet all cypressess way
she turns and moves uphill towards the house climbing over a low wall
feeling the first drops of rain on her bare arms she crosses the loggia
and quickly enters the house
